# OPC UA VMD Events ACAP

## Overview

This repository contains the source code to build a small [ACAP version 3](https://help.axis.com/acap-3-developer-guide) application that exposes
[AXEvent](https://www.axis.com/techsup/developer_doc/acap3/3.5/api/axevent/html/index.html) compatible scenario events (alarm status)
through [OPC UA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPC_Unified_Architecture) ([open62541](https://open62541.org/)).

> [!NOTE]
> Please note that even if this ACAP would fit right into your use case, its
> purpose is above all to serve as an example and boilerplate rather than being
> ready for production.

## Supported events

The ACAP application's backend can subscribe to the following ACAP applications:

- [AXIS Fence Guard](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-fence-guard)
- [AXIS Loitering Guard](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-loitering-guard)
- [AXIS Motion Guard](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-motion-guard)
- [AXIS Video Motion Detection (VMD) 4](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-video-motion-detection)

## ACAP architecture

## Usage

Requires any of the compatible video motion analytics ACAP applications referenced above, to be available on the device.

Create and enable a profile in the analytics ACAP ([VMD 4 profile example](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-video-motion-detection-4#how-to-work-with-profiles)). Then, install and configure the `OPC UA VMD Events` ACAP to pick up the chosen analytics ACAP events.

The exposed event profile names are of the following form: `CameraXProfileY` (i.e. `Camera1Profile1`, `Camera1Profile2`, etc.).
The special event `CameraXProfileANY` will always fire alongside any other profile event firing.

The OPC UA object view for a single analytics profile configured, looks like this:

The OPC UA Server port (default is 4840) can also be set through the ACAP's settings.

## Build

### Using the native ACAP SDK

```sh
# With the environment initialized, use:
acap-build .
```

### Using Docker and the ACAP SDK container

The handling of this is integrated in the [Makefile](Makefile), so if you have Docker on your computer all you need to do is:

```sh
make dockerbuild
```

or perhaps build in parallel:

```sh
make -j dockerbuild
```

If you do have Docker but no `make` on your system:

```sh
# 32-bit ARM
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg ARCH=armv7hf -o type=local,dest=. .
# 64-bit ARM
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --build-arg ARCH=aarch64 -o type=local,dest=. .
```
